# Malaria-Predictor-Keras-Transfer-Learning
Malaria Predictor using Keras Transfer Learning (VGG Net) with tkinter GUI

The Images were initially converted into 3 numpy arrays namely:
Train, Validation and Test arrays

The classifier notebook contains data visualization, Training, Saving.<br>
The prediction notebook contains Tkinter GUI for saved model used for making predictions on user's input image.<br>
The deployment notebook contains code to deploy the model on google colab<br>
Detailed information of deployment of models on colab is here on other repository : https://github.com/ArjunPukale/Deploy-ML-models-using-google-colab
